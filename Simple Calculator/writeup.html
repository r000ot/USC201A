<h4>Assignment:</h4>

<p>For this assignment, you are to develop a Java application that implements a calculator with a
graphical user interface (GUI). Your application should have a button for each mathematical operation and single digit number which the user must press to construct a valid number, and a window containing the current answer. At a minimum, your calculator should support real numbers and four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), as it shown in the picture below:

You can also add some other operations like square root or log. If you are really ambitious, you can even support a memory function that allows the user to "store" a value and then to call it up later.
